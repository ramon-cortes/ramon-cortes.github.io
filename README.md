#### What's next?

List of exercises has color changing when mouseover.
Testing on making the color change "fading". Almost have it working. But sometimes that *almost* takes a long time. Hope its not the case.

#### Other information

**Spoiler alert**

If you are taking the course *Professional Certificate in Coding* you should be aware that some exercises are solutions to some of the problems. It is recommended that you try to solve them on your own before looking into the code here.
