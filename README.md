#### What's next?

List of exercises has color changing when mouseover. 
**Now with fading effect**. It was not that complicated once I started understanding *setTimeout clearTimeout* and *addEventListener("mouseover"&"mouseleave"...*
Very happy I made it work.

#### Other information

**Spoiler alert**

If you are taking the course *Professional Certificate in Coding* you should be aware that some exercises are solutions to some of the problems. It is recommended that you try to solve them on your own before looking into the code here.
