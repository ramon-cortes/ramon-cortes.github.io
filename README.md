#### What's next?

Hopefully I will have a list of exercises using a better looking menu.
But no plans yet. I still don't know how to organize a website using div tags to split the screen and load an html there. I manage to do it but did not look as good as I wanted.

#### Other information

**Spoiler alert**

If you are taking the course *Professional Certificate in Coding* you should be aware that some exercises are solutions to some of the problems. It is recommended that you try to solve them on your own before looking into the code here.
